# Changelog

Notable changes to the Hermes Stackbook. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); entries describe documentation
releases, not software versions. Compatibility evidence for upstream components lives in the
[compatibility ledger](docs/compatibility.md), not here.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-15

Field-evidence corrections and additions from operating the reference deployment:

- Compatibility ledger: recorded the author's live field deployment (Hermes `7f179ba`,
  OMP 17.3.4) as a runtime-smoke row ahead of the pinned review anchor.
- Architecture + profiles: documented that a multiplexed gateway persists every served
  profile's live sessions in the serving profile's state database, and the empty-looking
  per-profile state file trap.
- Supporting services: clarified the local-inference rule (single *loaded* model versus a
  small deliberate on-disk inventory) and added three field-tested backup principles
  (backup plane survives the agent plane; stage live databases consistently; expose a
  narrow non-secret status projection).
- Scheduled jobs: named the two deliberate exceptions to silent-when-healthy
  (consumer-facing heartbeat jobs; bounded collector-to-reviewer handoffs).
- Operations: added the optional independent operator control-plane pattern.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-14

Initial release.

- Core private-stack guide: architecture, planning, installation, profiles and models,
  supporting services, security, operations, build sequence, and verification.
- Extension references: skills and plugins, suggested scheduled jobs, skill drift and
  extension/file drift runbooks, and the separate
  [hermes-omp-broker](https://github.com/ghosty-11/hermes-omp-broker) and
  [hermes-mailbox](https://github.com/ghosty-11/hermes-mailbox) packages.
- Template library: eleven public-safe templates and worksheets plus the proposed
  knowledge-base structure.
- Compatibility ledger and sources reviewed 2026-08-14.
